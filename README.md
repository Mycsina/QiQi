Scraping script for turning novels from websites like wuxiaworld.co into epubs.

Project abandoned due to rate-limits being implemented but at the time of writing (19-2-2021). 

Fully functional with the only problem being that if you set the max_workers setting too high, you'll be temporarily banned for an hour from wuxiaworld.co
